# TakingInitiative
This is a University project. This app tracks initiative roles and other stats for TTRPG.

My goal for this app is to help track combat initiative during a game for table top role playing games. The features of this app is to track character name and have a long side
side them is their initiative role and then have the list order by who has the highest initiative role. If a PC or NPC is killed during combat I have put a button to remove them from the list. My goal I am working on currently April 20th {4:06} am is to have the app cyle through the list having so who's ever turn it was currently would be at the top of the list and work down the list and restart when you get the bottom of the list. What I am considering doing is making the character whos turn it is highlighted so the user can tell whos turn it is.

To use this app first down and open it. Then add players to the app click the add button on the screen this will bring up the character and initiative screen. Enter the PC/NPC's name and what they rolled for initiative and hit complete when done it will then add them to the initiave list repeat this until you have your entire party and enemies int he list. This part I am still working as of April 20 4:38 am but click on a button to cylce through to the next PC/NPC once you have finished the round click on the button again and it will hopefully start from the top of the list. 

Problems I ran into:
The largest problem I had was getting my list layout and my mutable list to match together I found on making a to- do list that help. I also had problems making the mutable list, next was pairing the main activity to the character input activity. Finally I am still having having difficultly with this having the list cylce through the user inputs.

I did make the icon for the app using a pixel art drawing software. I was getting stress about the project and so I decided to draw an icon, I could still be considered doing working since it was for the app and watching D&D twitch streams could be considered research.
