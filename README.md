# TakingInitiative
This is a University project. This app tracks initiative roles and other stats for TTRPG.

My goal for this app is to help track combat initiative during a game for table top role playing games. The features of this app is to track character name and have a long side
side them is their initiative role and then have the list order by who has the highest initiative role. If a PC or NPC is killed during combat I have put a button to remove them from the list. My goal I am working on currently April 20th {4:06} am is to have the app cyle through the list having so who's ever turn it was currently would be at the top of the list and work down the list and restart when you get the bottom of the list. What I am considering doing is making the character whos turn it is highlighted so the user can tell whos turn it is.
